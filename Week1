=Supervised Learning=

where we can put machine learning into use: 
Input (x)  - ->     Output (y)        Application 
email                spam?(1/0)         spam filtering
audio                text transcripts   speech recognition
English              Spanish             machine translation 
ad, user info        click (1/0)         online advertising 
image, rader info    position of other cars  self-driving car

Types of Machine Learning: 
(1) Regression:
  definition: regression predicts a number infinitely many possible outputs
  
 
(2) Classification: 
  definition: classification predicts categories small number of possible outpus
  

=Unsupervised Learning=
- find something interesting in unlabeled data 
- unlabled data -> classified them into group by using clustering algorithm 
- use algorithm to group the data into different categories 
- clustering example:
  - music
  - DNA microarray
